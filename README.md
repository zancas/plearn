What is this?

Explanation 1:

  Duolingo for programming languages.

Explanation 2 (Algorithmically Selected "Chapter Exercises"):

  You're studying a textbook (do those still exist?).  At the end of the
  chapter are problems that help you to:

    * practice knowledge skills
    * learn what you don't know
    * learn what you do know

 This tool uses information about you (bound to a pseudonym), primarily the 
 history of your exercise responses, and others who are interested in the same
 topic to guess which _next_ exercise will teach you the most.

A Tool For Knowledge Acquisition

Plunder Knowledge

  This project uses the history of responses you and other plearners provide to
  learn which exercise will optimally enhance your understanding.
  
  Inputs include your preferences, (e.g. the topic you seek to mistress, how
  focused you feel, etc...), the history of your responses to previous
  exercises, and the values of those inputs associated with other plearners.
